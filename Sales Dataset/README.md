# Sales Analysis and Performance Dashboard

This repository contains the source data and documentation for a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard, developed using Power BI, that monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends across various regions, products, and customer segments.

## 💾 Data Sources

The analysis is based on two related CSV files derived from the original Excel workbook, **`Sales Dataset.xlsx`**, and the final dashboard is contained within the Power BI file.

1.  **`Sales Dataset.xlsx - ListOfOrders.csv`**: Contains high-level order and customer/location details.
2.  **`Sales Dataset.xlsx - OrderBreakdown.csv`**: Contains product-level details, sales figures, and profit data.
3.  **`Sales.pbix`**: The Power BI file containing the full interactive dashboard and report pages.
